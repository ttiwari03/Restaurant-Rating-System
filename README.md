# Restaurant-Rating-System

This is a java command line application that facilitates giving rating / review for a restaurant.
It provide commands for adding restaurant and users. Users can give rating for restaurant between 1 to 5. 
They can also provide review for restaurant which includes rating and description.
Ratings / Reviews for a restaurant can be fetched based on rating range and order. 
I have used command pattern here to execute various command options.
Request and response DTOs are used for adding and fetching rating / review.
I have also used Strategy pattern to filter and order fetched ratings of a restaurant.
